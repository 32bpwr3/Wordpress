*From the [Shepherd High School][1]:* * Seniors: As the end of the school year is nearing all seniors need to have their lunch account paid in full or have a positive balance. Any money left in your account will be mailed to your parent or guardian if over $5.00. All money $5.00 or less will be refunded to you in your graduation packet or you may stop in the cafeteria office between 9am - 2:30pm on **May 25th - May 27th** to get the balance owed you if less than $5.00. After we refund your balance, you will not be able to use your school lunch account anymore. If you have a sibling that you would like your balance to go to, please see Selena in the Cafeteria Office and she will transfer it for you. * Anyone interested in running for student council for the 2016-2017 school year, please see Ms. Chaney for an application.
