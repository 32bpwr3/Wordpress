> Here is an awesome tribute to our students and their continued excellence in and out of the classroom. Hi Joe, My name is Ashley and I am a Partner/Director of Marketing at Sound Productions Entertainment. Normally I work in the office but last Saturday we were short-staffed and I had the honor of running the photo booth at Shepherd High After-Prom. As I can't stop thinking about it, I just wanted to commend you on your wonderful students. Jim (the owner of Sound Productions and also the DJ at After-Prom) and I couldn't stop talking about them on the way back to Clare that night. We work with a ton of different local schools and the level of kindness, respectfulness, and friendliness your students displayed blew us away! Not to mention - They were the most polite and well-mannered school that I have worked with in a very long time. Not once did someone fail to say "Thank You!" while they were in my booth. In fact, it wasn't uncommon that they would say it multiple times! While I (fellow Shepherd alumni) may be biased and I wouldn't expect anything less from Shepherd students - It's great to see that Bluejay spirit and class is still alive and well! Please let me know if you need ANYTHING - DJ, Photo Booth, Transportation, A/V Services, etc. in the future. We LOVE working with your students so much, I am willing to discount services. Thank you so much and have a wonderful week! Best, ASHLEY J. BELLMER Director of Sales & Marketing Sound Productions Entertainment
